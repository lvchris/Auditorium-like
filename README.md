# Auditorium-like

Second Unity Project

Auditorium is a game created by Cipher Prime in 2009. The game is playable on this website : https://cipherprime.com/games/auditorium/.

In this game, the objective is to fill up the music box(es) in the level by redirecting small particles.

The particles are redirected by the player using effectors. The effectors have an area of effect and the larger it is, the farther the particles will go.

As the game goes on, the number of effectors and music boxes to fill increases.
The game uses ScriptableObjects to store data and game events to allow interactions among different scenes.
